Description: Computerized tomography (CT) can be used to assess certain wood properties when wood disks or logs are scanned. Wood density profiles (i.e. variations of wood density from pith to bark) can yield important information used for studies in forest resource assessment, wood quality and dendrochronology studies. The first step consists in transforming grey values from the scan images to density values. The packages then proposes a unique method to automatically locate the pith by combining an adapted Hough Transform method and a one-dimensional edge detector. Tree ring profiles (average ring density, earlywood and latewood density, ring width and percent latewood for each ring) are then obtained.
